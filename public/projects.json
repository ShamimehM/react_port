            "description2": "This thesis investigates the effectiveness of electroencephalography (EEG) and eye-tracking data, individually and in combination, for biometric user authentication. Using the EEGEyeNet dataset, which contains both EEG and eye-tracking recordings, the original eye-movement prediction task was restructured to focus on identity detection. A range of classical machine learning (ML) models and deep learning (DL) architectures were evaluated under both minimally and maximally preprocessed conditions, and implemented in both PyTorch and TensorFlow to ensure framework consistency. The results demonstrate that simple ML models such as Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB) and k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) consistently outperformed more complex models, including support vector machines (SVMs) and DL networks, in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency. Surprisingly, models trained on minimally preprocessed data yielded better performance than those using heavily cleaned signals, suggesting that aggressive artifact removal can eliminate identity-relevant information. Notably, combining EEG and eye-tracking features led to significant performance gains, highlighting the value of multimodal approaches for capturing robust biometric signatures. These findings underscore the potential of lightweight ML classifiers for real-time, resource-constrained biometric systems and emphasize the importance of preserving signal diversity during preprocessing. The study also raises questions about the scalability of current models and the need for fine-tuned DL architectures in future multimodal systems. Overall, this work provides practical insights into model selection, preprocessing strategies, and system design for physiology-based biometric authentication.",
