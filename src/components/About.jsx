    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I’m Shamimeh M. Nav, a researcher and AI developer based in Moss, Norway. My work centers on building trustworthy, human-centered AI—
      with experience across machine learning, deep learning, and data-driven experimentation.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m completing an MSc in Applied AI at OsloMet, where I’ve explored EEG and eye‑tracking for biometric authentication, developed NeRF‑based 3D
      reconstruction pipelines, and contributed to applied projects from health-tech to education. I enjoy turning complex ideas into rigorous, practical systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      Multilingual and collaborative, I value clarity, analysis, and iteration. I’m excited to keep building AI that is reliable, explainable, and useful.
